# Documentation to RWP\*Load Simulator

The documentation to the RWP\*Load Simulator is created using LibreOffice and
saved in the fodt - Flat Open Document Text - format.  
If you only have the pure source files, documentation will only be available as source
in this format, but if you have an install of libreoffice, you can run make in this 
directory to create pdb and html versions of the documentation.  

This directory also contains the full EBNF format of the syntax to the rwl language.
At http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui, you can upload this file and generate a nicely
looking and click-able syntax diagram.

If you get a binary distribution of the RWP\*Load Simulator, it is likely that both
of these have already been done for you.
