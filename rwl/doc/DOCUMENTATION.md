## RWP\*Load Simulator users guide

## RWP\*Load Simulator reference manual

The reference manual is distributed as a large number of pages that are very similar
to ordinary UNIX man-pages.
There is a single shell script, rwlman, that is used rather than the ordinary man
command, to display these. 
As a starting point, simply type
```
rwlman
```
