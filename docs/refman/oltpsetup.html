<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page shows
how to setup and configure the oltp workload that is
included with the RWP*Load Simulator</p>

<h2>PROJECTS
<a name="PROJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the system,
that will be your application server, you will be running
one or several projects that typically differ in how and to
which database they connect. Each project must have a short
name such as dbone, dbtwo, etc. For the rest of the
discussion on this page, the project name <b>key</b> is
used.</p>

<h2>DIRECTORIES
<a name="DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to run
the oltp workload, you need three directories:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>working
directory</b> where you keep the files that typically get
modified while you use the oltp workload. Each project will
be identified by its name and there will be two files
associated with each project; these files must be stored in
this directory. It is recommended that you create a
directory separately from your home directory, but you can
very well have multiple projects in the same directory as
each project normally just needs two files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>results
directory</b> that will be filled with subdirectories and
files when you are using the oltp workload. You should have
one directory per project, and you should prepare sufficient
space for about 0.5MB for each single run you perform. You
normally don&rsquo;t need to inspect or modify any of the
files created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An <b>awr
directory</b> that will be filled with subdirectories, html
files, graphs, etc while you perform the runs. This
directory must be visible externally via a browser, and it
must be writable by your login user. If you e.g. use Apache
as your web server, the directory typically must exist
somewhere under /var/www/html. You should plan to have
sufficient space for about 2MB-4MB for each single run.</p>

<h2>PREPARATION
<a name="PREPARATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From your
RWP*Load Simulator distribution, make copies of the two
files from the oltp directory, <b>oltp.env</b> and
<b>oltp.rwl</b> to your working directory, and make the
copies named after your project. If your project it named
<b>key</b>, the files must therefore be named <b>key.env</b>
and <b>key.rwl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file
<b>key.env</b> must be modified such that it sets the
environment variable RWLOLTP_NAME to your project name such
as <b>key</b>. If needed, you may also set environment
variables like TNS_ADMIN, TWO_TASK, etc.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your projects
parameter file such as <b>key.rwl</b> contains all settings
that define your project including database credentials,
connect strings, workload size, etc. Some settings are
compulary, others have defaults that you should initially
not change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
lists all compulsary parameters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>awrdirectory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the name of the directory
where awr, html, graphs, etc will be stored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>resultsdir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the name of the results
directory as explained above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>normal_connect
<br>
pool_connect <br>
batch_connect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the connect strings either
in URL style syntax such as //host/service or as names in
tnsnames.ora that will be used when the oltp workload is
executing its ordinary transactions. The first is used in
the few cases where pooling is not in effect, the latter are
used for the vast majority of cases where the transactions
use pooling, pool_connect for the typically short
transactions, batch_connect for the more batch oriented
transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
the three can be set to the same value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your
database under test is an autonomous database, you should
choose the connection names that have _tp at the end.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cruser_connect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Is set to the connect string
that will be used when schemas are created and filled with
data. In most cases, it can be the same as the
normal_connect, but if your database is an autonomous
database, using the name with _tpurgent at the end may make
data fill faster as it allows parallel processing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cruser_username
<br>
cruser_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set these to a username
respectively password that will be used for schema creation
combined with the cruser_connect connect string. The typical
username is &quot;system&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; in case
of autonomous databases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>system_connect
<br>
system_username <br>
system_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These will be used during
actual execution of your runs to do things like awr snapshot
gathering, queries against v$ tables etc. The typical
username is &quot;system&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; in case
of autonomous databases. You can normally set them to the
same values as used for schema creation, but if your
database is a PDB, and if you have access to the root
container, you should use the credentails for the root
rather than for the PDB. Doing so will make the awr reports
more comprehensive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you (as
recommended) have a separate database for your RWP*Load
Simulator repository, set these:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>results_in_test
:= 0; <br>
results_connect <br>
results_username <br>
results_password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Setting results_in_test to zero
implies the repository will not be created in your database
under test. In that case, the next three parameters must be
set to point to your already created repository
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
perform some quick tests and do not have an existing
RWP*Load Simulator repository, you can set these
parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>results_in_test
:= 1; <br>
results_connect <br>
results_username <br>
results_password <br>
rwloadsim_dir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Setting results_in_test to
non-zero implies the repository will be created in your
database under test unless one has already been created
there. The three next parameters will be used to create the
repository schema and later to access it. The rwloadsim_dir
parameter must be set to be the full pathname to the admin
directory of your installation of rwloadsim.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
execution, the oltp workload needs five different database
schemas, for which you must provide usernames and passwords.
This is done using these ten parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_aw1_username
rwl_aw1_username <br>
rwl_aw2_username rwl_aw2_username <br>
rwl_oe_username rwl_oe_username <br>
rwl_run1_username rwl_run1_username <br>
rwl_run2_username rwl_run2_username</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The usernames can be any
allowed schema names as long as the schemas not already
exists. It is, however, important that the names for the
last two can be identified using a like condition, so these
two are typically named RWLRUN1 and RWLRUN2, as the like
condition RWLRUN_ can be used to identify those. The
usernames must be written in upper case. The passwords must
be chosen to match any password restrictions of your
database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_run_like</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to the like condition that
identifies the last two schema names mentioned above. The
like condition must be written in uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next two
parameters control how big the aw_cols table is and how skew
the access to it is. If the table is almost as large as (or
even larger then) your buffer cache, you can get massive
reads if there is no skew in access to the table. The
purpose of the settings is to be able to adjust the actual
amount of physical reads in your database under test. Se the
oltp.rwl file for further information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aw_cols_256MB_doublings</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The table is created by first
filling it to roughly 256MB and then doubling it a number of
times; this parameter sets the number of times it gets
double from the initial 256MB. The default is 4 resulting in
an aw_cols table of an approximate size of 4GB.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>aw_cols_skew</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If not set, all rows in the
aw_cols table will be uniformly queried. If you set a value,
the rows actually queried will be skewly distriuted, the
higher the value, the more skew distribution. With higher
skew, the buffer cache gets more effective. Typical values
are in the range between 5 and 50, but you will normally
need to experiment, in particular if your aw_cols table is
as large as or ever larger than your buffer cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
your aw_cols <i>is</i> so large that it will not fit in your
buffer cache, you cannot completely prevent reads even with
very high values for aw_cols_skew, so the awr report will be
likely to report that your SGA is undersized. It is
debetable if this is a bug or a feature of the oltp
workload, and ideas for a better scheme are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
parameters impact the generated output and graphs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_title</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to a string that will be
put on all html files, graphs, etc that are generated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_daily_html</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to name the file that will
contain daily overviews when using the <a href="oltpday.html">oltpday(2rwl)</a>
utility; it should name a html file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rwl_heading</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to a string that will be
the heading for the daily reports, generated using
<a href="oltpday.html">oltpday(2rwl)</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
parameters are used to control the actual workload, and they
have reasonable default values. Note that only some
parameters are documented here, there rest are discussed in
the oltp.rwl file that you copied to a file named after your
project such as <b>key.rwl</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ratefactor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a double value (default
0.2) that sets the overall workload. You can very
approximately assume that with the default value together
with the defalt value for <b>threadcount</b>, making runs
with one process will require in the order of 0.2 database
cpu seconds per second.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>threadcount</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an integer value
(default 50) that sets the number of worker threads per
process. If you want to experiment with, as an example,
twice the load, you can do so by doubling either of
<b>ratefactor</b>, <b>threadcount</b>, or the number of
processes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>orders_hashcount</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If your database does not have
partitioning, set this to 0, otherwise leave it at the
default. This must be done before you run
<a href="oltpcreate.html">oltpcreate(2rwl)</a>.</p>

<h2>VERIFICATION
<a name="VERIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify the
directories and files are setup properly, run <b>oltpverify
-d</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify the
settings for system users are correct, run <b>oltpverify
-s</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify you
can connect to a repository, run <b>oltpverify -r</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create all
schemas, run <b>oltpcreate</b>; to drop all schemas expect
the repository, run <b>oltpdrop</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify
schemas are properly created, run <b>oltpverify -u</b>.</p>
