# This file specifies all strings used
# for test test databases
# You must make a copy in a directory only available
# to user and set strings properly below
#
# Then, export the environment RWLTESTUSER to be
# the full pathname of your file

# Set the connect string used by most
test_cstring := "//hostname/service:dedicated"; 
# And the connect string that gets a DRCP connection
test_cstring_drcp := "//hostname/service:pooled"; 

# Set the name and password for the ordinary
# user. It at all possible, give it the username
# rwltest as otherwise lots of test will have
# differences
test_user := "rwltest";
test_pass := "{password}";

# And set the values for connection as system
# to your root container.
# The username does not need to be SYSTEM, but
# it MUST be in upper case or you
# will get lots of differences
system_cstring := "//hostname/service:dedicated";
system_user := "SYSTEM";
system_pass := "{password}";
